    "The methodology used for the AXC Liquidity framework is provide maximum liquidity and minimize price slippage in the most capital efficient manner possible.  The methodology involves creating an environmental model which simulates the behavior of the market and then run simulations of the arbitrage bot and the liquidity framework in order to forecast liquidity."
