# Governance structure

![][image1]The governance structure of the AXC token issuance framework involves several key entities which are bound with each other and the investor through contractual relationships.   The purpose of these relationships is to set up a legal framework by which the token holder can economically benefit from value generated by the underlying without receiving local or beneficial ownership.  For the token holder to have direct ownership of the underlying creates various legal and regulatory difficulties.  Direct ownership makes it difficult to perform token transfers between token holders as well as introducing privacy concerns.  Moreover, direct ownership requires that intermediaries be licensed, which also introduces regulatory complexities.

The main mechanisms by which the token holder can receive the economic benefits of the underlying is through a series of contracts.  The main economic relationship between the token holder and the underlying is illustrated by dark lines illustrating the key contractual relationships.

The role of the entities are illustrated in the following table

| Entity | Role | Type | Legal Domicile | Operational location | Profit | Licensing |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Series DAO LLC | Hold underlying assets to segregate different tokens from each other | Created by Master LLC by operating agreement | Marshall Islands | Virtual /Contracts enforceable through arbitration in major financial center | Non-profit | None |
| Master DAO LLC | Create LLC and set up relationship with custodian | Marshall Island DAO LLC | Marshall Islands | Virtual /Contracts enforceable through arbitration in major financial center | Non-profit | None |
| Custodian | Hold fiat and cash on behalf of series LLC | Licensed Broker dealer | New Zealand | New Zealand with offices in major financial center | For-profit | Licensed to provide trading services by NZ |
| Underlying Asset Manager | Manage assets | Licensed asset management company | Caymans or BVI | Major financial center | For-profit | Licensed to manage client assets by HK and Dubai |
| Blockchain service provider | Operate token related platform | Technology services company | Caymans or BVI | Major financial center | For-profit | None |

The actors are represented by ovals and have the following roles

| Actor | Role | Return expectation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Token holders | Token holders have provided capital with expectation of receiving return on capital | Token holders expect to benefit from increase in price of shares due to gains in the underlying |
| Blockchain service provider shareholders | Service provider shareholders have contributed capital to the service provider with the expectation of receiving profits through share appreciation | Shareholders expect to a return on their capital to be paid for by fees in managing tokens |
| DAO Members | Setup structure.  No role in day to day operations and no legal entitlement to underlying economic benefits | As members of a non-profit they are legally unable to receive profit for their activity.   |

The contractual obligations are as follows

| Contract | Parties | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Terms and conditions contract | Token holders and the series LLC | Defines obligations to the token holders |
| Token description memorandum | Token holders and the series LLC | Describes the use of funds for the token |
| Custody / ownership contract | Master LLC and Series LLC | Allows the master LLC to act on behalf of the series LLC |
| Blockchain services contract | Series LLC and  Blockchain services company | Allows blockchain services company to provide technology services to the series LLC |
| Brokerage account | Master LLC and Custodian | This is a standard brokerage account agreement |

**Terms and services contract**

The key document is the terms and services contract.  This contract sets out the terms and conditions on which purchasers purchase the tokens.

The token description memorandum obligates the series LLC to make reasonable efforts to do the following but does that guarantee that the LLC will do so:

* To seek to track the value of the underlying  
* To make reasonable efforts to allow qualified non-retail token holders to redeem shares for proceeds from the sale of the underlying and to provide mechanisms for secondary liquidity

The token holder warrants and represents that they are a professional investor and not in any sanctions list or 

The terms and conditions explicitly states that the tokens owned and the funds provided under the legal and beneficial ownership of the Series LLC, and explicitly disclaims any custodial, trust, or agency relationship.  The terms and condition also contains standard disclaimers of liability and notices that are require

**Master / Series LLC**

Our structure segregates assets so that each token is associated with a specific series LLC under Marshall Island law.  Each series LLC has a separate contract with the management company, as well as the master LLC.  The contract with the master LLC is necessary due to the administrative difficulties in opening a separate bank or brokerage account for the Series LLC, and therefore an agreement between the master and series LLC is necessary to that any assets which are held by a bank or brokerage in the name of the master is clearly beneficially owned by the series company.

The judicial enforceability of the separation between master and series creates some legal risk.  The choice of dispute resolution as an arbitral body which would read the contract in terms of Marshall Island and hence Delaware law decreases the legal risk of veil piercing.  In addition, the intention is that all of the tokens issued by the master company are long-only and are financial only reducing the risk of tort liability or debt due to financial operations.

In cases where we would perform financial transactions that would result in short positions or could incur operational liability we would form another LLC and not rely on the legal separation on master/series.

**Flow of management fees**

The terms and conditions contract and token description memorandum allows for the series LLC to charge token holders a management fee and the series LLC may also receive fees from the underlying.  Under the terms of the management contract between the series LLC and the management company, all fees received by the series LLC from third parties minus amounts owed will flow to the management company.  Therefore the economic benefit for token holder management will accrue to the management company

**Location of legal domicile**

* Issuer is domiciled in Marshall Islands  
  * Marshall Islands is very innovative with crypto law and as a sovereign nation with a compact of free association of the United States it benefits from political stability and defense of the United States without adopting US securities regulation  
  * Marshall island allows for clean sheet creation of new legal forms and systems  
  * Marshall Island law is adapted from Delaware law which reduces legal uncertainty  
  * Marshall Island is viewed negatively by enterprises and therefore is not the ideal solution for companies wishing to raise capital through capital markets.

* Management company is domiciled in Cayman Islands  
  * Management company receives funding through VC and angel investment and Caymans Island is a known domicile for startups with an eventual view to exit through trade sale or IPO

* Operational location is major financial center  
  * Operational location insures that investors are protected by anti-fraud and anti-scam laws  
  * Dispute resolution and contract enforcement is done through arbitration panel in a major financial center, which is a well known and well regarded institution which is familiar with Delaware law

**Transparency and recourse**

The following data will be made available to token holders

1) The underlying product holder will be able to issue a statement showing the shares held through the custodian  
2) The custodian will provide information on what their underlying products and cash held by the the Series LLC  
3) The Series LLC will be able to report as the how many tokens have been issued

This information will allow token holders to be assured that the DAO is properly exercising their contractual obligations under the terms and conditions agreement.  In case the DAO does not fulfil its obligations, token holders can seek legal recourse through HK law enforcement and civil action.  

We are confident that neither situation will be necessary but have set up a legal structure so that the blockchain services company is under the criminal and anti-fraud jurisdiction of a major financial center.

IWhere there is  suspected fraud or illegal activity, token holders can contact the commercial crimes division of  the law enforcement of the jurisdictions in which the blockchain management company.  The appropriate law enforcement agencies can immediately issue a “Letter of No Consent’ to freeze the bank accounts of the blockchain services company.  A person that suspects fraud can also obtain an emergency Mareva injunction through a local court.  The court order would then be delivered to the legal staff which can then seize/freeze assets.  The court will then schedule an emergency hearing on the injunction.  If the request for injunction is found without basis then the court will quash the injunction and award court costs.

Where there is a civil dispute, the token holders can file a breach of contract arbitration with a reputable arbitration center.  If the token holders win in arbitration, then they can enforce the judgement through the courts and recover funds through court orders.

## Work flow for subscription and redemption

![][image2]

The subscription and redemption are subject to the subscription and redemption periods of the underlying assets which may take several weeks.  The underlying asset will have a window for subscription and redemption requests, typically at the end of each month, and the processing of subscription and redemptions may take several weeks.

The wallets are held by the series LLC, and the actions are performed by the blockchain service provider.

All subscriptions and redemptions will involve AML/KYC to the ultimate beneficial owner of the beneficiary.  In addition, the beneficiary must demonstrate that they are a professional investor under Hong Kong law and not subject to any limits due to sanctions and AXC will perform vetting of tokens accepted for subscription against token black lists.

* **Workflow for subscription**  
  * Token holder sends stablecoins to the deployed Vault Smart Contract. Once the Vault is Closed,the stablecoins in the smart Contract will be withdrawn to the Series LLC’s Segregated Treasury Wallet. RWAfi Series LLC wallet which then transfers stablecoins to the custodian, a New Zealand licensed FSPR. The custodian will then subscribe to the underlying asset and act as the custodian for the fund subscription. When new shares are issued,  RWAfi Series LLC will mint the RWA tokens and distribute them to on-chain investors.   
* **Workflow for redemption**  
  *  Series  LLC receives tokens and issues orders to the custodian to redeem underlying shares. The custodian  issues USDT to the series LLC and then tokens are burned and the USDT is sent to the investor.
