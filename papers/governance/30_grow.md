-------------------

Grow Heritage Token

The token seeks to track the value of the GROW Heritage Fund (the “Underlying”) by purchasing the shares of the Underlying with proceeds from the sales of tokens and to hold shares of the Underlying corresponding to tokens issued by the token manager.

To achieve the objectives of the token the token issuer may set aside a portion of the funds in stablecoin to provide liquidity for the token and may engage in token issues and buybacks in order to provide liquidity.  

The token issuer shall disclose to the investors the strategies that the token issuer intends to use to track the value of the underlying, and the allocation of the tokens for providing liquidity. This strategy disclosure shall be updated monthly under normal market conditions, but may be changed in response to market conditions.

The token issuer intends to be long only and shall not use margining or short positions under any circumstances and will avoid synthetic products as much as practicable.

The token issuer may issue tokens to represent underlying assets which are held off-chain, and may include the value of those tokens as part of total value locked.  

The token issuer may charge a reasonable fee for their services and may use the proceeds of this Token to pay for necessary and reasonable costs associated with the purchase, sale, and transfer of the fund shares, and may hold liquid assets pending subscription or redemption of fund shares. 

These tokens are subject to the General Terms and Conditions for tokens issued by the token issuer.
