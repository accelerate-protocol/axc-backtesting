After logging into the Investor Portal, you'll be prompted to complete two types of applications:

1.  **Investing Entity Application (required)**: This application collects information about your investing entity to verify your eligibility to access either onchain equities or AXC funds. For a list of documents that we require during this application, please see [Onboarding: Required Documents](https://docs.axc.xyz/onboarding-required-documents)
    
2.  **Fund Applications**: Investors who submit proof of accredited investor status, and who wish to invest in AXC Funds must complete separate applications for each one to verify your eligibility to invest. Users who do not provide proof of accreditation status cannot apply to these funds.
    

* * *

Once you've submitted either your entity and fund applications, our team will review them carefully. We assess your eligibility based on several factors, including compliance checks, anti-money laundering (AML) screening, and accreditation status. If we need any additional information, we'll reach out to you directly.

Following approval, we'll send you an Investment Agreement that is populated with information provided in the application process for your review and execution. Once this is signed, you're ready to start investing.
