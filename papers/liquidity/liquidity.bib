	abstract = {Since the launch of Uniswap and other {AMM} protocols, the {DeFi} industry has evolved from simple constant product functions with uniform liquidity distribution across the entire price axis to more advanced mechanisms that allow Liquidity Providers ({LPs}) to concentrate capital within selected price ranges. This evolution has introduced new research challenges focused on optimizing capital allocation in Decentralized Exchanges ({DEXs}) under dynamic market conditions. In this paper, we present a methodology for finding optimal liquidity provision strategies in {DEXs} within a specific family of \${\textbackslash}tau\$-reset strategies. The approach is detailed step by step and includes an original method for approximating historical liquidity within active pool ranges using a parametric model that does not rely on historical liquidity data. We find optimal {LP} strategies using a machine learning approach, evaluate performance over an out-of-time period, and compare the resulting strategies against a uniform benchmark. All experiments were conducted using a custom backtesting framework specifically developed for Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers ({CLMMs}). The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed methodology are demonstrated across various Uniswap v3 trading pairs, and also benchmarked against an alternative backtesting and strategy development tool.},

	abstract = {We present a mathematical formulation of liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges. We focus on constant function market makers of utility indifference type, which include constant product market makers with concentrated liquidity as a special case. First, we examine no-arbitrage conditions for a liquidity pool and compute an optimal arbitrage strategy when there is an external liquid market. Second, we show that liquidity provision suffers from impermanent loss unless a transaction fee is levied under the general framework with concentrated liquidity. Third, we establish the well-definedness of arbitrage-free reserve processes of a liquidity pool in continuous-time and show that there is no loss-versus-rebalancing under a nonzero fee if the external market price is continuous. We then argue that liquidity provision by multiple liquidity providers can be understood as liquidity provision by a representative liquidity provider, meaning that the analysis boils down to that for a single liquidity provider. Last, but not least, we give an answer to the fundamental question in which sense the very construction of constant function market makers with concentrated liquidity in the popular platform Uniswap v3 is optimal.},

	abstract = {Decentralized finance ({DeFi}) has revolutionized the financial landscape, with protocols like Uniswap offering innovative automated market-making mechanisms. This article explores the development of a backtesting framework specifically tailored for concentrated liquidity market makers ({CLMM}). The focus is on leveraging the liquidity distribution approximated using a parametric model, to estimate the rewards within liquidity pools. The article details the design, implementation, and insights derived from this novel approach to backtesting within the context of Uniswap V3. The developed backtester was successfully utilized to assess reward levels across several pools using historical data from 2023 (pools Uniswap v3 for pairs of altcoins, stablecoins and {USDC}/{ETH} with different fee levels). Moreover, the error in modeling the level of rewards for the period under review for each pool was less than 1{\textbackslash}\%. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the backtester in quantifying liquidity pool rewards and its potential in estimating {LP}'s revenues as part of the pool rewards, as focus of our next research. The backtester serves as a tool to simulate trading strategies and liquidity provision scenarios, providing a quantitative assessment of potential returns for liquidity providers ({LP}). By incorporating statistical tools to mirror {CLMM} pool liquidity dynamics, this framework can be further leveraged for strategy enhancement and risk evaluation for {LPs} operating within decentralized exchanges.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2106.12033},
	abstract = {Uniswap v3 is the largest decentralized exchange for digital currencies. A novelty of its design is that it allows a liquidity provider ({LP}) to allocate liquidity to one or more closed intervals of the price of an asset instead of the full range of possible prices. An {LP} earns fee rewards proportional to the amount of its liquidity allocation when prices move in this interval. This induces the problem of \{{\textbackslash}em strategic liquidity provision\}: smaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and correspondingly larger fees when the price remains in the interval, but with higher risk as prices may exit the interval leaving the {LP} with no fee rewards. Although reallocating liquidity to new intervals can mitigate this loss, it comes at a cost, as {LPs} must expend gas fees to do so. We formalize the dynamic liquidity provision problem and focus on a general class of strategies for which we provide a neural network-based optimization framework for maximizing {LP} earnings. We model a single {LP} that faces an exogenous sequence of price changes that arise from arbitrage and non-arbitrage trades in the decentralized exchange. We present experimental results informed by historical price data that demonstrate large improvements in {LP} earnings over existing allocation strategy baselines. Moreover we provide insight into qualitative differences in optimal {LP} behaviour in different economic environments.},
